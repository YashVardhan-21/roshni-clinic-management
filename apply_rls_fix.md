# Fix for Loading Issue - RLS Policies

## Problem
New users get stuck in loading after login due to:
1. Missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies on business logic tables
2. API calls returning 406/400/404 errors
3. AuthContext not properly handling API failures

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created RLS Policies Migration
- File: `supabase/migrations/20250115_fix_rls_policies.sql`
- Added RLS policies for all business logic tables:
  - services
  - appointment_slots
  - appointments
  - patient_assessments
  - therapy_sessions
  - exercise_assignments
  - patient_progress
  - payments
  - invoices

### 2. Fixed AuthContext
- File: `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`
- Added proper error handling for profile fetch failures
- Ensures loading state is always set to false
- Creates mock profiles when API calls fail

### 3. Improved Patient Dashboard
- File: `src/pages/patient-dashboard/index.jsx`
- Added graceful fallback when API calls fail
- Uses empty arrays instead of crashing when data is unavailable

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Apply Essential Tables and RLS (Recommended)
Use the comprehensive migration that creates both tables and RLS policies:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250115_essential_tables_and_rls.sql`
4. Run the SQL script

### Option 2: Apply Safe RLS Policies Only
If the business logic tables already exist, use the safe version:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250115_fix_rls_policies_safe.sql`
4. Run the SQL script

### Option 3: Apply via Supabase CLI
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd roshni_clinic_management

# Apply the essential tables and RLS migration
supabase db push
```

## Expected Results
After applying these fixes:
1. New users should no longer get stuck in loading
2. API calls should work properly with proper RLS policies
3. The app should gracefully handle API failures with fallback data
4. Users will see a functional dashboard even if some data is missing

## Testing
1. Create a new user account
2. Login with the new account
3. Verify the dashboard loads without getting stuck
4. Check browser console for any remaining errors
